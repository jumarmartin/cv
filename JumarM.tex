\openitem{Courseadvysr}{A service that was written to challenge—and now aiming to overtake—Elon University’s course search tool by providing better tools to decide which class to take. 
I host this service on a bare-metal SaaS server in a docker instance, \textbf{PostgreSQL} for the backend, \textbf{Golang} as the middleware, \textbf{Redis} to serve as a cache and broker authentication requests, and \textbf{ReactJS} as the presentation framework.}

\begin{itemize}
\secitem{Software Engineer Intern}
{Cruise | Mapping, Data Ingestion}
{Aug. 2022}{Dec. 2022}
{The Mapping Data Ingestion team owns the story of mapping data from capture to operation. My deliverables focused primarily on improving robustness and resiliency in the pipeline from mapping vehicle to autonomous operations. In tandem with delivering on team-related tasks, I built an offline-first internal tool that centralized company terms. After a company-wide demo, I worked with both Developer Experience, Developer Productivity, and Technical Writing teams to bring it company-wide.}

\secitem{Software Engineer Intern}
{Lyft | Driver Experience, Driver Productivity}
{May 2022}{Aug. 2022}
{Driver Experience aims to win driver preference by providing superior transparency and control. Amongst an 8.8\% increase in driver scheduled rides takeups by implementing an entrypoint in the unified schedule, I drove the prioritized implementation of bringing upfront pay swap notifications to parity with non-upfront pay and implemented new reasons to improve visibility into the reason a driver was swapped.}

\secitem{Software Development Engineer Intern}
{Amazon | Alexa Skills Kit}
{Jan. 2022}{Apr. 2022}
{As a member of the Vertical Kits team, I extended the Offers product to include the ability to reference by name instead of position, a highly requested feature by end users. This included designing a new schema for third-party partners to provide offer names and custom synonyms while also leveraging the Alexa Voice Service—an internal NLP product—to extend that synonyms list automatically.}

\secitem{Software Engineer}
{Celera Technologies}
{Jun. 2021}{Jan. 2022}
{Using \textbf{Python 3.9}, I architected automated systems that provide the ability to rapidly validate custom Integrated Circuits, generate mission-critical documentaiton for engineers and customers, and on average save 120 hours per week on once-manual tasks.}

{Elon Society of Computing}
{Apr. 2019}{Jan. 2022}
{Serving as President of ESC, I transferred ownership of Courseadvysr to the newly-found ESC Student Development Team and continually led that team in developing new features and services, recreated the event planning to allow students to easily follow a Research or Real World-focused track, and expanded ESC’s reach as a strong department-affiliated organization.}
