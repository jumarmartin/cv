    \secitem{Software Engineer Intern}
    {Cruise | Mapping, Data Ingestion}
    {Aug. 2022}{Dec. 2022}
    {The Mapping Data Ingestion team owns the story of mapping data from capture to operation. My deliverables focused primarily on improving robustness and resiliency in the pipeline from mapping vehicle to autonomous operations. In tandem with delivering on team-related tasks, I built an offline-first internal tool that centralized company terms. After a company-wide demo, I worked with both Developer Experience, Developer Productivity, and Technical Writing teams to bring it company-wide.}

    \secitem{Software Engineer Intern}
    {Lyft | Driver Experience, Driver Productivity}
    {May 2022}{Aug. 2022}
    {Driver Experience aims to win driver preference by providing superior transparency and control. Amongst an 8.8\% increase in driver scheduled rides takeups by implementing an entrypoint in the unified schedule, I drove the prioritized implementation of bringing upfront pay swap notifications to parity with non-upfront pay and implemented new reasons to improve visibility into the reason a driver was swapped.}

    \secitem{Software Development Engineer Intern}
    {Amazon | Alexa Skills Kit}
    {Jan. 2022}{Apr. 2022}
    {As a member of the Vertical Kits team, I extended the Offers product to include the ability to reference by name instead of position, a highly requested feature by end users. This included designing a new schema for third-party partners to provide offer names and custom synonyms while also leveraging the Alexa Voice Service—an internal NLP product—to extend that synonyms list automatically.}

    \secitem{Software Engineer}
    {Celera Technologies}
    {Jun. 2021}{Jan. 2022}
    {Using \textbf{Python 3.9}, I architected automated systems that provide the ability to rapidly validate custom Integrated Circuits, generate mission-critical documentaiton for engineers and customers, and on average save 120 hours per week on once-manual tasks.}

    {Elon University Computer Science Project Team}
    {Jan. 2023}{May 2023}
    {After recognizing the need for affiliate access to university data, I founded the CS Project Team, a group dedicated to delivering innovative solutions to the Elon community. Our first project was a platform for Elon affiliates to access previously inaccessible data in partnership with Elon University. Through extensive collaboration with university stakeholders, we established a groundbreaking partnership between students and the institution, paving the way for future technical partnerships and creating a new paradigm for student-university interaction. I led a team in delivering a product that transformed the way students and faculty interacted with university data, providing open access to information and creating new opportunities for innovation, research, and problem-solving on campus.}
