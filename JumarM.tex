        As the Founder of the Open Data Service at Elon, I led a cross-functional organization in designing and implementing a cutting-edge full-stack service that streamlined data access for the university community.
        Utilizing a \textbf{dependency injection} paradigm and automating deployment with \textbf{Terraform} and \textbf{Docker}, we taught members how to contribute to open-source projects and use tools that they'll see when they enter the workforce.

    %     Running it back for another summer, the Mapping Data Ingestion team owns the story of mapping data from capture to operation.
    %     My deliverables focused primarily on improving robustness and resiliency in the pipeline from mapping vehicle to autonomous operations.
    %     In tandem with delivering on team-related tasks, I built an offline-first internal tool that centralized company terms.
    %     After a company-wide demo, I worked with both Developer Experience, Developer Productivity, and Technical Writing teams to bring it company-wide.

        Driver Experience aims to win driver preference by providing superior transparency and control.
        Amongst an 8.8\% increase in driver scheduled rides takeups by implementing an entrypoint in the unified schedule, I drove the prioritized implementation of bringing upfront pay swap notifications to parity with non-upfront pay and implemented new reasons to improve visibility into the reason a driver was swapped.

    {
        As a member of the Vertical Kits team, I extended the Offers product to include the ability to reference by name instead of position, a highly requested feature by end users.
        This included designing a new schema for third-party partners to provide offer names and custom synonyms while also leveraging the Alexa Voice Service—an internal NLP product—to extend that synonyms list automatically.

    {After recognizing the need for affiliate access to university data, I founded the CS Project Team, a group dedicated to delivering innovative solutions to the Elon community. Our first project was a platform for Elon affiliates to access previously inaccessible data in partnership with Elon University. Through extensive collaboration with university stakeholders, we established a groundbreaking partnership between students and the institution, paving the way for future technical partnerships and creating a new paradigm for student-university interaction. I led a team in delivering a product that transformed the way students and faculty interacted with university data, providing open access to information and creating new opportunities for innovation, research, and problem-solving on campus.}
