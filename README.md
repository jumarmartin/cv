# cv

This is my cirrculum vitae and resume.

Definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae): A curriculum vitae, Latin for "course of life", often shortened as CV or vita, is a written overview of someone's life's work.

This is my life's work, up to this point.

These documents are set in Avenir. 
Avenir comes standard with macOS but you can also acquire Avenir to properly type these files from the internet.
If you choose to use a different font (defined in [listofpersonalprofessionalachievements.cls](./listofpersonalprofessionalachievements.cls), note that this might mess with the bounding boxes and margins.
